Description

As web developers, we want a deployed portfolio that can showcase our work to potential employers and clients. It is in that spirit that our program Denver University coding bootcamp required us to build a front and back end website starting from scratch. For this project, we decided to make an application that users can come to the website, sign in, and input info about themselves. The server will recognize the inputs and grab queries from databases we built and build them a profile page.

The profile page will include a horoscope definition that will go into multiple fases of your birthdate. It will also provide a birth stone based on your birth month. There will be a tarot reading also based on your birth month. 

Programs used

We used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, MySQL, Sequelize, Lodash.js, Passport.js, and Express. We also used Git/Github as a version control.

Installation

This is only a website and does not need installation. it is currently hosted in github and you can access it at https://to be added/
